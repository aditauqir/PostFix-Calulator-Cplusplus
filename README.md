## How does this work?

It utilizes vector and stack libraries in CPP to evaluate the equation. It first converts the string equation to a vector array and then converts the said vector array to a postfix array called `postfix` and utilizes a stack to push and pop accordingly to evaluate the final result.

#### CLI Features

Incorporated QOL features such as a menu and ASCII arts to make it look more appealing.
